This is the initial *expirimental* manifest. Sync AT YOUR OWN RISK 


$ mkdir -p ~/bin
$ mkdir -p ~/SOA

$ curl https://dl-ssl.google.com/dl/googlesource/git-repo/repo > ~/bin/repo
$ chmod a+x ~/bin/repo

$ export PATH=${PATH}:~/bin

$ cd ~/SOA
$ repo init -u git://github.com/SonsOfAndroid/android.git

$ repo sync

<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
After Repo Is Synced, place your desired device tree in the required device folder (ie: t0lte would belong in the SOA/Device/Samsung directory)

Check that you have all required dependency files listed in the soa.dependencies file in the tree

CD to device tree path && run ./extract-files.sh while Device is connecyed via USB

CD back to main SOA directory and type

. build/envsetup.sh && export USE_CCACHE=1 && croot && brunch (device codename)

Now go do something productive... Depending on your machine this could take several hours to finish compiling





If you want to add into the main SOA system, we will need to submit every change for review and will be decided upon before being merged into the main repos




If you decide to post a build, all we require is that you shoot PTMR3 a pm to let us know
 and clone any of the original OPs including The header and donation link. 

If you are not a member of DD/SOA dev team, you must label your thread 'Unofficial'

thank you
